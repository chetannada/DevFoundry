### 🎯 Challenge Overview

#### 🕒 Estimated Completion Time: 45–60 minutes

#### 🛠️ Task Overview:

Create a stepper interface that guides users through a multi-step process. Each step should display relevant content and allow navigation between steps using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

#### 📌 Requirements:

- 🪜 **Step Navigation**: Visual indicator of current step with progress tracking.
- 📄 **Step Content**: Each step displays unique content (e.g., Passenger Info, Flight Selection, Payment, Review).
- ⏮️⏭️ **Previous/Next Buttons**: Navigate between steps with clear state management.
- ⚛️ **State Management**: Use React hooks to track current step and form data.
- 🎨 **Styling**: Responsive and modern layout using TailwindCSS.

#### 🔍 Development Focus:

- **Component Modularity** → Reusable Stepper and Step components.
- **UX Clarity** → Clear step transitions, contextual instructions, and visual feedback.
- **Accessibility** → Keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, and ARIA roles.
- **Layout Stability** → Smooth transitions and consistent spacing across steps.

#### 🌟 Additional Considerations:

- Add validation logic before allowing step progression.
- Support dynamic steps or branching flows.
- Consider animating transitions between steps for smoother UX.
